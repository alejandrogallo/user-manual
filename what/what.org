#+title: About the code


Cc4s is a high-performance open-source coupled cluster simulation code.  The
coupled cluster approach is used as so-called post Hartree--Fock method for
solving the electronic Schr√∂dinger equation
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupled_cluster). The main application of cc4s
is to study the electronic properties of solid-state systems.  Solving the
coupled cluster equations for these systems is computationally demanding.
Therefore ctf (https://github.com/cyclops-community/ctf), an efficient parallel
tensor contraction library,  is used to solve the underlying coupled cluster
equations.  Cc4s needs on input a reference wavefunction, typically obtained
from a Hartree--Fock calculation. Currently, interfaces are available  for
=vasp= and =fhi-aims=.
