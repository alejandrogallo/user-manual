#+title: About the code

Cc4s is a *high-performance* open-source coupled cluster simulation code.

The coupled cluster method is used as a so-called post Hartree-Fock method for
solving the electronic Schr√∂dinger equation ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupled_cluster][wikipedia]]).

The main application of cc4s is to study the electronic properties of
solid-state systems.
Solving the coupled cluster equations for these systems is
computationally extremely demanding.
Therefore we make use of state-of-the-art high-performance libraries
such as [[https://github.com/cyclops-community/ctf][CTF]], an efficient parallel tensor contraction engine,
and leverage computational paradigms such as MPI
and OpenMP based parallelization.

In general terms, =cc4s= takes as input a reference wavefunction
together with a description of the Coulomb integrals.
Currently, interfaces are available for the codes [[https://vasp.at][VASP]] and [[https://fhi-aims.org/][FHI-AIMS]].
