* Definition

The =CoulombVertexSingularVectors= object contains the transformation from the auxiliary-field basis to the
plane-wave basis $U_{G}^{F}$ as input.
This transformation matrix needs to be provided by the interfaced
electronic structure code and should be read in from an external file using the *TensorReader* algorithm.
