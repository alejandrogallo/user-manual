* Brief description

=Amplitudes= are a set of tensors, usually containing the closed-shell
singles $t_i^a$ and the doubles $t_{ij}^{ab}$ amplitudes, such that
the closed-shell coupled-cluster correlation energy is given by
\begin{equation}
  E_\mathrm{cc}
  = \frac12 \sum_{abij}
    \left(t^{ab}_{ij} + t^a_i t^b_j\right)
    \left(2V^{ij}_{ab} - V^{ji}_{ab}\right)
\end{equation}
Note, that the closed-shell doubles amplitudes are symmetric with respect
to interchanging left and right inidices $t^{ab}_{ij}=t^{ba}_{ji}$.

* Specification

The amplitudes are generated by the [[id:CoupledCluster][CoupledCluster]]
algorithm by solving the amplitude equation of the employed
coupled-cluster method.
