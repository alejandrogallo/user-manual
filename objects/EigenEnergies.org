* Brief description

=EigenEnergies= are one-electron Hartree--Fock energies $\varepsilon_p$
for the states $p$. The states $p$ must be ordered such that their
energies $\varepsilon_p$ are non-descending. All objects with
indices referring to states $p$ must be in the same order.

* Specification
Unlike in other objects, the Fermi energy $\varepsilon_\mathrm{F}$ and
all energies $\varepsilon_p$ must
also be listed in the =metaData= section such that =cc4s=
can determine the number of occupied and virtual states during
a dry-run without reading the content file =EigenEnergies.elements=.
