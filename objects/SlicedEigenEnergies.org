* Definition

$$ V^{pq}_{sr} := {\Gamma^\ast}^{pG}_s \Gamma^q_{rF}$ $$

The =CoulombIntegrals= $ are computed from the =CoulombVertex=, which can
be respresented in an arbitrary basis set depending on the employed interface
cite:&hummel2017low.

The =CoulombIntegrals= are computed from the =CoulombVertex= using the
*VertexCoulombIntegrals* algorithm using; for example, the following
yaml input file

#+begin_src yaml
- name: VertexCoulombIntegrals
  in:
    slicedCoulombVertex: CoulombVertex
  out:
    coulombIntegrals: CoulombIntegrals
#+end_src

We note that the *VertexCoulombIntegrals* algorithm of =Cc4s= only prepares
a recipe for the actual computation of the various =CoulombIntegrals=.
The computation is performed only once the factual tensors are needed by
a subsequent algorithm which needs the =CoulombIntegrals= as an input argument.
