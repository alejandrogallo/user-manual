* Definition


The =coulombPotential= keyword requires the Coulomb potential in a plane-wave basis set representation $\tilde{v}(G)$ as input.
The Coulomb potential has to agree with the one employed for the calculation of the Coulomb vertex.
The Coulomb potential should be read in from an external file using the *TensorReader* algorithm.
