* Brief description

The =GridVectors= object contains the grid vectors of the employed plane-wave
basis set $\{ G_1, ...,G_n \}$.
The set of grid vectors needs to be provided by an interfaced electronic structure theory package
and can be read in using the [[id:Read][Read]] algorithm.

(including the factor $2\pi$).
