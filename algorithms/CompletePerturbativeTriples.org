* Brief description
Evaluates the (cT) contribution.
* TODO Algorithm call


* TODO Algorithm input
* Algorithm output


* Sample =yaml= output

* Computational complexity

The computational cost is $\mathcal{O}{(N_o^3 N_v^3(N_o+N_v))}$ with $N_o$ and 
$N_v$ being the number of occupied and virtual orbitals, respectively. The memory
footprint is mainly determined by the storage of the PPPH-integral, which is of 
size $\mathcal{O}{N_o N_v^3}$.
* Theory

The implemented expressions of (cT) correspond to those from Ref. [cite:@PhysRevLett.131.186401].
