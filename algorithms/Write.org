* Brief description
=Write= writes a cc4s tensor or set of tensors.

* Algorithm call

A typical input file snippet to call the [[id:Write][Write]]
algorithm is given below.

#+begin_src yaml
- name: Write
  in:
    fileName: "StructureFactor.yaml"
    source: SF
  out: {}
#+end_src


* Algorithm input

# #+caption: Input keywords

** what
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: what
:END:

Defines the yaml file name where the tensor or sets of tensors are written to.

** data
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: data
:END:

Defines the tensor or sets of tensors that should be written to disk.
