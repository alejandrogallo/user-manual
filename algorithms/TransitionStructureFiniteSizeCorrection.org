The =interpolationGridSize= keyword can be used to control the finesness of the grid used to interpolate the
electronic transition structure factor in each spatial direction.
A value of $N$ for the =interpolationGridSize= means that $2 N$ sampling points are used to sample the interpolated structure factor in each direction.

The output of the *TransitionStructureFactorFiniteSizeCorrection* algorithm includes transition structure factor $S(G)$ and
an estimate of the finitie size error correction to the correlation energy. The finite size error is estimated using a tricubic interpolation
algorithm of the electronic transition structure factor.

Below an example standard output stream is shown for a successful *TransitionStructureFactorFiniteSizeCorrection* algorithm run.

* Computational complexity

No considerable memory footprints or computational cost bottle necks are expected for this algorithm compared.

* Theory

The methods employed in this algorithm are discussed in Refs. cite:&liao2016communication and cite:&gruber2018applying .
We employ a tricubic interpolation technique to reduce
quadrature errors in the numerical expression of the electronic correlation energy: $\sum_{ G}S({ G}){\tilde{v}}({ G})$.
In particular, the quadrature errors around ${G}=0$ are large and result in significant finite-size errors for small simulation cells.
In order to obtain a more accurate estimate of the correlation energy in the thermodynamic limit,
we proceed as follows.
We introduce additional sampling points at an arbitrarily dense
grid, which we choose to be $2N\times 2N \times 2N$ times denser than the original one.
The interpolated transition structure factor and the analytic expression of the Coulomb kernel can be used
to calculate the correlation energy with the usual expression given above.
The difference between the correlation energies computed with the interpolated and non-interpolated structure factor
yields an estimate of the finite correction to the electronic correlation energy that is returned by this algorithm.
We find that $N=20$ yields well converged correlation energies for sufficiently large unit cells.
However, we recommend to check convergence with respect to this parameter for each system separetely.
