#+title: Common inputs for =cc4s= algorithms

This page describes common input variables used
consistently in the same way in several algorithms in =cc4s=.

* Inputs
** amplitudes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: amplitudes
:END:

The =amplitudes= keyword requires the singles and doubles amplitudes as input.
These amplitudes can be obtained using the [[file:CoupledCluster/CoupledCluster.org][*CoupledCluster*]] algorithm.
