#+title: Algorithms in CC4S

* Algorithms in CC4S


The most important CC4S algorithms are listed below.

- SecondOrderPerturbationTheory
- CoupledCluster [[file:CoupledCluster/CoupledCluster.org][CoupledCluster]]
- PerturbativeTriples
- FocalPointBasisSetCorrection
- FiniteSizeCorrection
- CcsdReference

Each algorithm should be briefly described by the following subsection:
- Input/Output
- Theory
- Computational Complexity

!TODO: we need nomenclature for algorithms and input/output objects.
