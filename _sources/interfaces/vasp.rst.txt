Description of VASP interface to Cc4s
=====================================


.. contents::

This section explains the ``VASP`` workflow to calculate occupied and unoccupied one-electron orbitals, as well as all necessary input files for ``Cc4s``.
Basic knowledge with VASP is assumed.
In addition, we refer to the `Wiki page of VASP <https://www.vasp.at/wiki>`_.

An example ``bash`` script performing all following steps for a periodic BN crystal is available here `here <../data/run_vasp.sh>`_.

**Step 1**: Hartree-Fock: Occupied orbitals
-------------------------------------------

In this and all following steps we assume that the required ``VASP`` input files (``INCAR``, ``POSCAR``, ``POTCAR`` and ``KPOINTS``) are present in the same working directory.
We assume that the ``KPOINTS`` file samples one :math:`k` -point of the first Brillouin zone only.
We initialize the Hartree-Fock (HF) step by a preceding density functional theory (DFT) ground state calculation using the following ``INCAR`` file. 
The individual flags will be explained below.

.. code:: sh
    :name: dft-incar

    ENCUT   = $encut
    NCORE   = $ncore
    ISMEAR  = 0
    SIGMA   = 0.001
    ISYM    = -1

Although not essential, the DFT preparation usually increases the stability of the subsequent HF iteration procedure in ``VASP``.
The produced ``WAVECAR`` file is then read in the HF step for which we use the following ``INCAR`` file.

.. code:: sh
    :name: hf-incar

    ENCUT   = $encut
    NCORE   = $ncore
    ISMEAR  = 0
    SIGMA   = 0.001
    ISYM    = -1

    ALGO    = A
    EDIFF   = 1E-7
    LHFCALC = T
    AEXX    = 1.0

The tag ``ENCUT`` defines the plane-wave basis set size by a kinetic energy cutoff in eV. 
It is advisable to set ``ENCUT`` to a value which is at least 20% larger than the largest ``ENMAX`` entry in the ``POTCAR`` file.
For optimal performance on multi-core machines set ``NCORE`` to the number of cores per socket. 
The ``ISMEAR`` and ``SIGMA`` ensure integer occupancies of the one-electron orbitals and can safely be used for all insulating systems with a finite band gap.
We recommend to use the conjugated gradient algorithm for the iterative HF procedure by setting ``ALGO=A``.
For properly converged Hartree--Fock orbital energies, we choose a break condition of :math:`10^{-7}\,\text{eV}` by setting ``EDIFF=1E-7``.
Further information on the used tags can be found in the VASP wiki.

**Step 2**: Hartree-Fock: Unoccupied orbitals
---------------------------------------------

Coupled cluster theory approximates the many-electron wave function using excited Slater determinants contructed from occupied and unoccupied orbitals.
We compute all unoccupied HF orbitals in the given plane-wave basis as described below.
The total number of HF orbitals/bands is equal to the number of plane-waves and can be found in the ``OUTCAR`` file of the HF ground state calculation in the following way.

.. code:: sh
    :name: nbands

    nbands=`awk '/number of plane-waves:/ {print $5*2 -1} ' < OUTCAR # OUTCAR file from HF ground state calculation using gamma-only code
    #nbands=`awk '/number of plane-waves:/ {print $5} ' < OUTCAR # OUTCAR file from HF ground state calculation using complex code

Please note, that ``VASP`` automatically adjusts the number of bands to be a multiple of the number of MPI ranks in ``VASP`` calculations for reasons of parallelization.
Note that ``nbands`` should be determined in a different manner when using the complex version of ``VASP``.

Ensure that the ``WAVECAR`` file contains all converged occupied HF orbitals as described above and use the following ``INCAR`` file to calculate the unoccupied HF orbitals:

.. code:: sh
    :name: hfv-incar

    ENCUT   = $encut
    NCORE   = $ncore
    ISMEAR  = 0
    SIGMA   = 0.001
    ISYM    = -1

    ALGO    = Exact
    LHFCALC = .TRUE.
    AEXX    = 1.0
    NBANDS  = $nbands
    NELM    = 1

Here, an exact diagonalisation (``ALGO=Exact``) of the Fock matrix with dimension  ``nbands`` :math:`\times` ``nbands`` is performed.
This is a single-shot step, i.e. no iterations are necessary: ``NELM=1``.
Save the ``WAVECAR`` file containing all unoccupied (virtual) orbitals, e.g. ``mv WAVECAR WAVECAR.HFV``.

**Optional Step 2-(a)**: MP2 for focal-point basis-set correction
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For the `BasisSetCorrection <../algorithms/BasisSetCorrection.html>`_ algorithm the `MP2 pair energies matrix <../objects/Mp2PairEnergies.html>`_
is needed. This input file can be obtained from VASP using automated extrapolation techniques for MP2 pair energies.
Make sure to employ the ``WAVECAR`` file from the previous calculation (``WAVECAR.HFV``) that contains all orbitals.
In dependence of the system size, two VASP algorithms are available.
For small systems (e.g. less than 50 occupied orbitals with ``NBANDS`` < 20 \* occupied orbitals) the following ``INCAR`` can be used

.. code:: sh
    :name: mp2_1-incar

    ENCUT    = $encut
    ISMEAR   = 0
    SIGMA    = 0.001
    ISYM     = -1

    ALGO     = MP2
    LHFCALC  = .TRUE.
    AEXX     = 1.0
    NBANDS   = $nbands
    LSFACTOR = .TRUE.

For larger systems, the low-scaling algorithm (Sch{\\"{a}}fer, Tobias and Ramberger, Benjamin and Kresse, Georg, 2017) might be faster and less memory consuming.

.. code:: sh
    :name: mp2_2-incar

    ENCUT    = $encut
    ISMEAR   = 0
    SIGMA    = 0.001
    ISYM     = -1

    LMP2LT     = .TRUE.
    ALGO       = ACFDTRK
    NOMEGA     = 6
    LDUMPMP2IJ = .TRUE.
    LHFCALC    = .TRUE.
    AEXX       = 1.0
    NBANDS     = $nbands

This algorithm is based on a Laplace transformed (LT) MP2 formulation using ``NOMEGA = 6`` sampling points for the Laplace integration. This setting is sufficient for large gap systems. For small gap systems try with ``NOMEGA = 8`` or even higher. 
For an efficient parallelization, use the ``KPAR`` flag and set it to a divisor of the number of mpi-ranks (optimally half of the number of mpi-ranks).
In case of memory issues, reduce ``KPAR``.

NOTE: The basis-set extrapolation procedures between the different MP2 algorithms in VASP
differ and for consistency reasons one should not compare extrapolated correlation
energy estimates between different algorithms.

NOTE: This low-scaling algorithm heavily relies on FFTs. For efficiency reasons, please use ``PRECFOCK = Fast`` consistently in all post-HF or post-DFT VASP runs. 
For further details, please check the `LTMP2 - Tutorial <https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/LTMP2_-_Tutorial>`_ in the VASP wiki.

At the end of this ``VASP`` calculation the following input files needed by ``Cc4s`` are written to disk. 

- `Mp2PairEnergies <../objects/Mp2PairEnergies.html>`_ (:math:`\epsilon_{ij}`) : ``Mp2PairEnergies.yaml``, ``Mp2PairEnergies.elements``

**Optional Step 2-(b)**: Approximate natural orbitals
-----------------------------------------------------

The convergence of the electronic correlation energy is very slow when using canonical Hartree--Fock orbitals.
Approximate natural orbitals allow for achieving a more rapid correlation energy convergence to the complete basis set limit.
Here, we compute these natural orbitals as described below and using
Eq.2 from Ref. (Grüneis, Andreas and Booth, George H and Marsman, Martijn and Spencer, James and Alavi, Ali and Kresse, Georg, 2011).
However, alternative approaches such as ``ALGO=RPANO`` exist in ``VASP``.
Make sure to employ the ``WAVECAR`` file containing all orbitals (``WAVECAR.HFV``).

.. code:: sh
    :name: hfv-incar

    ENCUT   = $encut
    ISMEAR  = 0
    SIGMA   = 0.001
    ISYM    = -1

    ALGO    = MP2NO
    LHFCALC = .TRUE.
    AEXX    = 1.0
    NBANDS  = $nbands
    LAPPROX = .TRUE.

This ``VASP`` calculation will produce the ``WAVECAR.FNO`` file containing all unoccupied natural orbitals.
We choose to work with a small subset of these natural orbitals. We recommend to use 10 unoccupied natural orbitals per occupied orbital in combination with the
`BasisSetCorrection <../algorithms/BasisSetCorrection.html>`_ algorithm of ``Cc4s``. The corresponding number of orbitals can be obtained
using the following command.

.. code:: sh

    nbands=`awk <OUTCAR "/NELEC/ { print $3/2 * 11 }"`

All ``Cc4s`` algorithms are currently based on canonical formulations.
To this end we need to re-canonicalize the subset of natural orbitals by performing another ``VASP`` calculation.
Make sure to use the ``WAVECAR.FNO`` file as input, ``cp WAVECAR.FNO WAVECAR`` and employ the following ``INCAR`` file.

.. code:: sh
    :name: hfno-incar

    ENCUT   = $encut
    NCORE   = $ncore
    ISMEAR  = 0
    SIGMA   = 0.001
    ISYM    = -1

    ALGO       = sub
    LHFCALC    = .TRUE.
    AEXX       = 1.0
    NBANDS     = $nbands
    NBANDSHIGH = $nbands
    NELM       = 1

The ``NBANDSHIGH`` tag makes sure that exactly the number of orbitals specified by ``NBANDS`` will be used regardless of the number of MPI ranks.
Save the ``WAVECAR`` file containing the re-canonicalized unoccupied natural orbitals, e.g. ``mv WAVECAR WAVECAR.CNO``.

**Step 3**: Computing ``Cc4s`` input files
------------------------------------------

In the final step we call ``VASP`` using the ``WAVECAR`` file with the desired choice of unoccupied orbitals (e.g. ``cp WAVECAR.HFV WAVECAR`` or ``cp WAVECAR.CNO WAVECAR``) and
the following ``INCAR`` file.

.. code:: sh
    :name: cc4s-incar

    ENCUT   = $encut
    NCORE   = $ncore
    ISMEAR  = 0
    SIGMA   = 0.001
    ISYM    = -1

    ALGO        = CC4S
    EDIFF       = 1E-5
    NBANDS      = $nbands
    NBANDSHIGH  = $nbands
    ENCUTGW     = $encutgw
    ENCUTGWSOFT = $encutgw
    ISYM        = -1


This step produces the following input files needed by ``Cc4s`` 

- `Eigenenergies <../objects/EigenEnergies.html>`_ (:math:`\epsilon_{p}`) : ``EigenEnergies.yaml``, ``EigenEnergies.elements``

- `CoulombVertex <../objects/CoulombVertex.html>`_ (:math:`\Gamma^{pG}_{q}`) :  ``CoulombVertex.yaml``, ``CoulombVertex.elements``

- `GridVectors <../objects/GridVectors.html>`_ (:math:`\vec G`) : ``GridVectors.yaml``, ``GridVectors.elements``

- `CoulombPotential <../objects/CoulombPotential.html>`_ (:math:`V(\vec G)`) : ``CoulombPotential.yaml``, ``CoulombPotential.elements``

- `DeltaIntegrals <../objects/DeltaIntegrals.html>`_ (:math:`\delta^{ab}_{ij}`) : ``DeltaPPHH.yaml``, ``DeltaPPHH.elements``

- `DeltaIntegrals <../objects/DeltaIntegrals.html>`_ (:math:`\delta_{ij}`) : ``DeltaHH.yaml``, ``DeltaHH.elements``

- `CoulombVertexSingularVetors <../objects/CoulombVertexSingularVectors.html>`_ (:math:`U_{G}^{F}`) : ``CoulombVertexSingularVectors.yaml``, ``CoulombVertexSingularVectors.elements``
