Cc4s is a **high-performance** open-source coupled cluster simulation code.

The coupled cluster method is used as a so-called post Hartree-Fock method for
solving the electronic Schr√∂dinger equation (`wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.html/wiki/Coupled_cluster>`_).

The main application of cc4s is to study the electronic properties of
solid-state systems.
Solving the coupled cluster equations for these systems is
computationally extremely demanding.
Therefore we make use of state-of-the-art high-performance libraries
such as `CTF <https://github.com/cyclops-community/ctf>`_, an efficient parallel tensor contraction engine,
and leverage computational paradigms such as MPI
and OpenMP based parallelization.

In general terms, ``cc4s`` takes as input a reference wavefunction
together with a description of the Coulomb integrals.
Currently, interfaces are available for the codes `VASP <https://vasp.at>`_ and `FHI-AIMS <https://fhi-aims.html/>`_.
