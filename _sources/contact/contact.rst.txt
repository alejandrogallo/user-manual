The code is mainly developed in the group of Andreas Gr√ºneis at the Technical
University Vienna `https://cqc.itp.tuwien.ac.at/ <https://cqc.itp.tuwien.ac.at/>`_.

If you have questions about installing or applying cc4s, you can open an issue
on gitlab `https://gitlab.cc4s.html/cc4s/cc4s/-/issues <https://gitlab.cc4s.html/cc4s/cc4s/-/issues>`_. You can also write an
email to any of the `developers <../acknowledgements/acknowledgements.html>`_, but we would recommend the
use of gitlab.
