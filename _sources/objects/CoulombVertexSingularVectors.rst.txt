1 Brief description
-------------------

The ``CoulombVertexSingularVectors`` object contains the transformation from the auxiliary-field basis to the
plane-wave basis :math:`U_{G}^{F}` as input.
This transformation matrix needs to be provided by the interfaced
electronic structure code and should be read from an external file using the
`Read <../algorithms/Read.html>`_ algorithm.

.. code:: sh

    - name: Read
      in:
        fileName: "CoulombVertexSingularVectors.yaml"
      out:
        tensor: CoulombVertexSingularVectors
