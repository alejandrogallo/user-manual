Welcome to the =Cc4s= user manual. The following sections explain everything from
downloading the code to running calculations.

** How to get started?
- [[file:./gettingstarted/gettingstarted.org][Download, compile and run tests]]

** How to run Cc4s calculations?

We provide the following examples that teach you how to perform =Cc4s= calculations
- r-BN CCSD(T) calculations
- Water examples

** Interfaces to Cc4s
Currently avaible interfaces to =Cc4s= are described below.
- [[file:interfaces/vasp.org][VASP]]
